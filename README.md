about developer tools
## Project ID: 
 use project id when creating mods so that the project connects to the same mail server.
## Current URL: 
 you can use ?= at the end of a url, and use text extension to find that data to input variables and such

Network type, downlink speed, rtt, and generation are all network related and do not serve much to the project.
### developer tools are housed in the last sprite, make sure to use the input blocks there when making features with this.
